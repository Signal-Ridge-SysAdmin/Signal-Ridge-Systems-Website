        Signal Ridge Systems helps adults build confidence with everyday technology —
        computers, phones, email, online safety, and the tools people now rely on to work,
        communicate, and manage their lives.

      <p class="lead">
        This isn’t about “keeping up.” It’s about understanding what you’re using,
        making informed choices, and not feeling embarrassed for asking questions.

      <h3>Why this matters</h3>
      <p class="kicker">
        Technology shouldn’t be a source of stress or shame
      </p>

      <p>
        Many people were never given a solid foundation with computers and digital tools.
        Others learned just enough to get by — until something breaks, changes, or goes wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        Signal Ridge Systems exists to close that gap. Not by overwhelming people with
        features, but by teaching the parts that actually matter and explaining
        <em>why</em> things work the way they do.

      <h3>About the founder</h3>

      <p>
        Signal Ridge Systems was founded by William Zade, a technologist, veteran,
        and long-time community advocate.
      </p>

      <p>
        William has spent years working in IT, systems administration, and user support,
        helping people solve real problems — not just technical ones, but the confusion
        and frustration that often come with them.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a veteran and a family man, he understands the value of patience, clarity,
        and meeting people where they are. Signal Ridge Systems reflects those values
        in every session and workshop.
